# Linear Regression Model from Scratch Documentation

## Overview
This Python script implements a Linear Regression model using the Ordinary Least Mean Square (OLS) approach. The goal is to predict the target variable (Y) based on an independent variable (X).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-model.git
   cd linear-regression-model

    Install the required libraries:

    bash

pip install pandas numpy

Download the dataset or replace the file path in the code with your dataset.

Run the script:

bash

    python linear_regression_model.py

Code Structure

    Importing Libraries: The necessary Python libraries (pandas, numpy) are imported.

    Getting Data: The script reads a dataset from a specified file path.

    Selecting Variables: The independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables are selected from the dataset.

    Calculating Coefficients (m and b): The mean of X and Y is calculated, followed by the determination of coefficients using the OLS approach.

    Model Accuracy Evaluation:
        Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): A metric to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
        R2 Score: A measure of how well the model fits the data.

Dataset

The script assumes a dataset with columns for the chosen independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables. Replace the file path with your dataset.
Model Evaluation

The script calculates coefficients, RMSE, and R2 score to assess the accuracy of the model.
